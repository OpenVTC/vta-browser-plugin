 *  also the mediator the wallet authenticates to for DIDComm login, so the
 *  wallet is already a registered recipient there.
 *
 *  NOTE: this is baked into the DID at first mint, so changing it mints a NEW
 *  holder DID (which must be re-granted in the RP ACL). The options page
 *  handles that re-mint explicitly; `loadHolder` only uses it for a fresh mint. */

 * `chrome-extension://<id>` is the effective origin; WebAuthn
 * rejects `chrome-extension:` scheme as an rpId, so we pass the
 * bare id (the authenticator stores the credential against
 * that). The authenticator uses the same rpId on every unwrap.
 *
 * Exported because both `loadHolder` (read side) and the
 * onboarding installer in `offscreen.ts:doOnboardConnect` (write
 * side) need the SAME wrap — installing with one wrap and
 * loading with a different one would brick the wallet on the
 * next boot.

/** Load the wallet's holder identity (strict — v4 only).
 *
 *  - v4 record present → return the VTA-minted holder.
 *  - v3 record present but no v4 → throws `RequiresReonboardError`. The
 *    wallet predates the M2C identity migration and the operator must
 *    re-onboard.
 *  - neither → throws `NoHolderError`. Fresh install — operator should
 *    onboard.
 *
 *  Callers that need to surface these to the popup should catch and
 *  branch on `error.name`. The unhandled-throw path lands as a generic
 *  error and the operator gets a generic "wallet error" — fine for a
 *  prototype, less so for production UX.
 *
 *  When `encryptHolderSecret` is on, the persisted Ed25519 secret is
 *  unwrapped through a `WebAuthnPrfSecretWrap` — the first invocation
 *  per cold-start prompts the operator for their authenticator; subsequent
 *  invocations in the same SW lifetime reuse the in-memory derived key. */
